# **Garfield Feast Chase Game**

This will be a goofy game about avoiding Nermal at all cost to have a perfect Monday. Collect 30 lasagnas to help Garfield have the best Modays since he's known for hating them. Again, avoid Nermal at all cost, we don't want to be stuck with the adorable annoying kitten. 

Have fun!


The whole process for this was MESSY! I originally had one plan that DID NOT go as planned. I had to watch so many youtube videos on multiple stuff like how to make a start menu, I had to referesh my memory with a lot of the content. Adding an obstacle, Nermal, was a major headache. Some of the youtube videos that I saw about it gave me headaches, but one simplified it and it helped so much. Throughout the process I had so many bugs, from typos, to coding that just made no sense. I eventually just wrote some variables in full caps since my Dyslexia was acting up which caused many set backs. I hope I organized the coding properly, I wanted everything that made sense grouped together. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the process. Do I wish I did more? Absolutely! I wish I added sound, a boost object that would make Garfield faster or even attract the lasagnas towards him. As well as add negative objects that would be a negative for him. Either way, I'm glad with my goofy little project, and in all honesty, I never thought I would have enjoyed coding so much. It was a great course with a great professor and wonderful TA's. Thank you and have a great summer!
