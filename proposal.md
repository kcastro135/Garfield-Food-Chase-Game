# Garfiled Lasagna Feast

## Repository
<https://github.com/kcastro135/Garfield-Food-Chase-Game.git>

## Description
Just a goofy little game to have the player collect lasagna to please Garfile.

## Features
- Pixelish style
	- The characters will look stylized in a pixels artstyle, like a retro game
- Options
	- Collect 30 lasganas to win the game
- 
	- Avoid Nermal

## Challenges
- Adding boosts and multiple obsitcales
- I'm planning on making the art myself, so I need to start storyboarding and writing everything
- Any errors could throw off my coding and I need to be very specific with the commands

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I want Garfield to be allowed to interact with the enviorment, while avoiding nermal. Some objects gives him boosts.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare minimal would be just getting the lasgana while avoiding nermal

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Getting the pngs
  2. Getting started on the look as well as coding the basic skeleton

- Week 2
  1. Adding more details, maybe an openig screen and polishing the code
  2. Maybe sound if that's possible(I'll look at some online tutorials)

- Week N (Final)
  1. Testing it out, and making any corrections
  2. Record video and submit(hoping it comes out like I intend it)
