# My Little Pony Infection Game

## Repository
<https://github.com/kcastro135/MLP-Infection-Game.git>

## Description
This is based on a tiktok trend that involves the My little pony charcaters in a horror themed AU. It will involve the player playing
as Twilight Sparkle and you are given choices. I entend to have three out comes, the good ending, the bad ending, and the canon ending.

## Features
- Pixelish style
	- The characters will look stylized in a pixels artstyle, like a retro game and it will have on screen dialog.
- Options
	- Each option will end up giving the user three different endings depending on their choices
- 
	- Each choice causes a different outcome

## Challenges
- The amount of choices that I need to make. I will have to branch them out and that will evaluate the ending
- I'm planning on making the art myself, so I need to start storyboarding and writing everything
- Any errors could throw off my coding and I need to be very specific with the commands

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- I want the game to come out looking like those choice horror games that are mainly still images, sounds, dialog, and choices. Sort of like the game Homicipher and The Walten Files. I want each choice to be hard on the player as well as have good visuals(for what I can do).

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare minimal would be the texts, very pixaled characters and instead of three endings it would be two.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Writing the choices and how they branch out
  2. Getting started on the look as well as coding the basic skeleton

- Week 2
  1. Adding more details, maybe an openig screen and polishing the code
  2. Maybe sound if that's possible(I'll look at some online tutorials)

- Week N (Final)
  1. Testing it out, and making any corrections
  2. Record video and submit(hoping it comes out like I intend it)
